# Unity-DissolvingEffect
This is an implemention of dissolving effect learned from the article by Brecht.

[Dissolving The World Part 1](https://madewith.unity.com/stories/dissolving-the-world-part-1)

The shader uses [3D noise](https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/2d-3d-4d-optimised-perlin-noise-cg-hlsl-library-cginc.218372/) which is done by Lex-DRL, so make sure you import **noiseSimplex.cginc**

While I was searching 3D noise solution I found Voleuro also has an [experiment](https://github.com/Voleuro/unity-experiments) for this effect, he did well so you might want to have a look.
